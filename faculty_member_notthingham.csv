The underlying objective of my current program of research is to examine the physiological mechanisms that underpin the relationship between primate behaviour, individual fitness, and population survivability, with a particular emphasis on primate social evolution. I am director of the Swebeswebe Primate Research Project and have studied wild primates in South Africa since 2012. While most of my research is observational in nature, I also take experimental and mechanistic modelling approaches to the study of primate environmental physiology and biological evolution.

Areas of clinical research interest for Professor Rutella’s team include:
Novel immunotherapy approaches for haematological malignancies.
Elements of this research work focus on the challenges encountered with the effective treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and combine systems biology approaches (targeted immune gene expression and miRNA profiling, spatially-resolved transcriptomic/proteomic profiling, spectral flow cytometry, computational immunology and bioinformatics expertise) to:
-Discover gene signatures that are reflective of general immune status and predictive of anti-cancer immune potential;
-Assess immune cell infiltration and the expression of immune checkpoint molecules;
-Identify ‘actionable’ targets/molecular pathways that can predict patient outcome and therefore assist the tailoring and improve the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions.
IFN-gamma-mediated tumour immune evasion and response to immunotherapy.
Pro-tumorigenic activities of IFN-gamma have recently emerged depending on the context, intensity and durability of IFN-gamma signalling. The research team is studying whether T-cell infiltration and IFN-gamma production in the AML bone marrow microenvironment correlate with patient response to immunotherapeutic agents, including bispecific antibodies and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. Cutting-edge technologies, such as GeoMx-DSP and single-cell RNA-sequencing, are being used to analyse the location, density and functional orientation of the different immune cell populations in primary tissue biopsies, i.e., the ‘immune contexture’ of the tumour microenvironment. We are also focusing on the role played by IFN-stimulated genes in mediating resistance of AML cells to chemotherapy agents.
Analysis of high-dimensional transcriptomic data from human tumours.
We have curated publicly available datasets for AML, melanoma, ovarian, prostate, lung and colorectal cancers. Each data set is currently being mined for multiple cancer-related features, including signatures of immune effector senescence. The group has expertise in the identification of molecular drivers of cancer phenotypes based on artificial neural network (ANN) analysis. We are also using immune deconvolution algorithms (CIBERSORT; PRECOG; EPIC; quanTIseq) to infer the frequency and quality of tumour-infiltrating immune cells from transcriptomic datasets and to identify immune determinants of patient response to therapy.
Pharmacological re-activation of mutant TP53 in acute myeloid leukaemia and its effect on the expression of inflammatory mediators.
TP53-mutated human malignancies, including AML, are characterised by chemotherapy resistance and have a poor clinical outcome. The great majority of TP53 mutations in AML are associated with loss-of-function (LOF) of the mutated protein. The team have generated data showing that TP53 mutations correlate with the expression of inflammatory molecules in the tumour microenvironment. This element of work aims to understand how the pharmacological re-activation of TP53 affects the expression of inflammatory genes in AML cells, with a focus on interferon-inducible molecules and on actionable  immune checkpoints. We use state-of-the-art gene expression profiling and proteomics platforms, as well as conventional cellular and molecular immunology techniques, to interrogate the immune transcriptome and proteome of AML cells harbouring common TP53 mutations, also dissecting the interplay between TP53 and STAT1, a key interferon-stimulated gene.

Dr Siegkas’ research within the field of solid mechanics includes developing and implementing experiment and modelling techniques related to material behavior and impact energy management in biomechanics and aerospace applications. Projects involved close collaboration with both industrial and academic partners of various fields. Current research interests include 3D printing, personalised protective equipment, and engineered meta-materials.
Porous-Cellular Materials
Dr Siegkas’ DPhil was focused on developing experiments and modeling techniques to characterise and model the static and dynamic performance of porous- cellular materials for use as biocompatible bone implants, and applications within the aerospace industry. Experiments involved mechanical testing at various strain rates and included the use of high speed photography, in-situ SEM, X-ray micro-tomography and image analysis.
A computational method was developed for virtually generating porous material prototypes and capturing their mechanical behavior at different scales thus providing a tool for virtual prototyping and characterisation, based on application requirements. The foam geometries were generated in Matlab using a method based on Voronoi polyhedrals, that could either mimic geometrical features (e.g. pore size distribution) obtained by X-ray tomography analysis or generate new prototype geometries. The geometries were then subjected to uniaxial and multiaxial mechanical loading at the mesoscale level from which the macroscale properties were obtained. The virtual specimens were simulated using finite element techniques (Abaqus) at different strain rates. The project was partially funded by Rolls Royce, EPSRC and in collaboration with the IMI Canada.
Metal Alloys-Ballistics-Aerospace Components
Dr Siegkas worked on the ballistic performance of granular materials (including Nickel at temperatures up to 800 degrees Celsius and Titanium alloys at room temperature) and jet engine components. The research was related to the aviation safety and impact energy management (i.e. jet engine fan blade off e.t.c.).
The projects were focused in designing experiments to generate data for material model calibration and validation or used for the development and optimisation of new materials. The aim was to capture the material mechanisms involved in managing energy dissipation and related to application requirements. The work was done in collaboration with industrial partners (Rolls Royce, TIMET) and has received a departmental award under the University of Oxford departmental recognition scheme. Results were subject to publishing restrictions.
Traumatic Brain Injury and Protective Equipment
During a PDRA position at Imperial College London, Dr Siegkas worked on projects related to understanding and preventing traumatic brain injury. The work involved implementing finite element models and extracting information as to regions of the brain that were mechanically affected by impact loading.
One of the projects was funded by the ‘’Welcome trust network of excellence’’ and was carried by a multidisciplinary team of experts from the fields of biology, neuroscience and solid mechanics. The second project was funded by the Welsh Government and was a collaboration between Imperial College and industrial partners (Dainese-AGV manufacturer of motorcycle helmets, Armougel manufacturer of liner add-on material). Dr Siegkas' role involved both experiments and computational modelling. Experiments included liner material characterisation (polymer), drop tower experiments on helmets (with and without added liner) and fitted on an instrumented head form. Modelling included using a head and brain model to extract information regarding potential injury and a full helmet-head form (Hybrid III) model of the drop tower tests aiming to extract information for further liner design and optimisation.",petros siegkas,petros.siegkas@ntu.ac.uk,School of Science & Technology,"Research areas

Dr. McArdle is a Research Scientist in Tumour Immunology whose focus is on the development of T-cell vaccines against cancers. In particular, Dr. McArdle has identified a mutated Prostatic Acid Phosphatase, PAP, derived sequence, which, when injected with CAF09, a strong adjuvant (kind gift from Dr. Dennis Christensen, Serum Institute, Denmark), is capable of generating T-cells that produce high level of IFNg against vaccine-derived wild-type peptides using ex-vivo ELISPOT assay. This sequence has now been granted patent in Europe and in the US. Preclinical works are ongoing to gather the necessary data for a phase-0/I clinical trial for the treatment of hormone resistant prostate cancer. Dr. McArdle is also working on a HAGE- and mutated NY-ESO1-derived peptide sequences for the treatment of Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC). HAGE antigen has previously been shown to be a prognostic marker for breast cancer patients and a predictor of response to adjuvant chemotherapy (Abdel-Fatah, et al. 2014). In collaboration with Dr. Abdel-Fatah, HAGE was shown to be expressed in 47% of TNBC (Abdel-Fatah, et al. 2016). Dr. McArdle has recently set up a new collaboration with Dr. Sara Mangsbo at Upsala University (Sweden) where immune complexes will be used to deliver and stimulate strong immune responses against HAGE and NY-ESO1 sequences.
In addition, in collaboration with Scancell Ltd she is investigating the potential use of a combined TRP2 and WT1 vaccine for the treatment of Glioblastoma. Many of these antigens can also be used against other cancer, for example, HAGE and WT1 are also being investigated for the treatment of Leukaemia.
Dr. McArdle collaborates with many European laboratories which offers strong adjuvants such as CAF09 (Dr. Dennis Christensen, Serum Institute, Denmark), Immune-complexes (Dr. Sara Mangsbo (Upsala University, Sweden), L-Dopa, a precursor of melanin (Dr. Antoine Carpentier, Université Paris Descartes, Paris, France) as well as UK collaborator such as Prof. Lindy Durrant (Immunobody®, Nottingham University).
Dr. McArdle has also a particular interest in the effect of exercise, mental health and gut microbiota on the immune system of cancer patients and a study in ongoing in prostate cancer patients to assess the level of inflammation related molecules, the psychological status and the gut permeability of prostate benign vs cancer patients. She is keen to emphasise the importance of one’s life style on one’s health. She has previously organised two “Health and Well Being” day dedicated to promote self-help.

Mark Turner,mark.turner@ntu.ac.uk,School of Science & Technology,"Research areas
Research in the Turner laboratory focuses upon elucidating molecular causes of disease and in identifying new treatment options. Specific areas of research are as follows:
Diet and Diabetes
Elevated circulating glucose and fatty acid concentrations are known to trigger and exacerbate type 2 diabetes. Dr Turner’s group is interested in identifying those genes whose expression becomes dysregulated during diabetes development, thereby leading to impaired function of key cells and tissues regulating glucose homeostasis. Recent research from the Turner group utilising both Affymetrix microarray and Illumina HiSeq next generation sequencing has enabled us to identify thousands of pancreatic genes whose expression level changes following exposure to high levels of glucose and/or fatty acids. Using a combination of different state-of-the-art non-biased bioinformatic algorithms we have now identified multiple pathways and individual targets that form the basis for current and upcoming outputs and investigations.
Protein Adduction, and Protective Action of Reactive Species Scavenging, in Metabolic Diseases
Proteomic data has recently been acquired from pancreatic beta-cells, skeletal muscle, and serum, detailing advanced glycation and lipidation endproduct modification of proteins exposed to metabolic stress. Crucially, the naturally occurring dipeptide, carnosine, can prevent / reverse many of these damaging modifications, indicating potential therapeutic action of this molecule. However, carnosine turns over quickly in the body, so we are currently screening and characterising a number of slowly-hydrolysable analogs (that act as either carnosinase inhibitors or carnosine mimetics) which could potentially be developed as more powerful treatments for metabolic diseases, including diabetes, obesity, and cancer.
Identification and Manipulation of Novel Targets to Enhance Insulin Secretion
Existing diabetes therapies tend to become less effective over time, meaning that there is an urgent and currently unmet clinical need to develop new therapeutic strategies to enhance insulin secretion. Dr Turner’s group has identified a number of intracellular signalling pathways linked to insulin secretion which become dysregulated by glucose and fatty acids. Translational molecular strategies are being pursued that can modify activity of these pathways, with the aim of developing new therapeutic treatments based on these strategies.
Current opportunities exist to carry out postgraduate research towards an MPhil / PhD in the areas identified above. Further information may be obtained on the NTU Research Degrees website:  https://www.ntu.ac.uk/research/research-degrees-at-ntu

Farooq Sher,farooq.sher@ntu.ac.uk,Department of Engineering,"Research areas
Dr Farooq Sher current research overviews the diverse range of approaches and technologies to minimise emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) a greenhouse gas from the use of fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas). It also includes developing technologies to remove carbon dioxide from the flue gases of power plants and chimneys, as well as burn the fuels in pure oxygen (Oxy-fuel), which results in a flue gas that consists entirely of carbon dioxide and water vapours that can be captured relatively easily and can be stored safely in repositories deep underground. Moreover, He is working towards nanomaterials synthesis with applications in wastewater treatment, sustainable energy, climate change and low carbon technologies. The main interests are in the conversion of renewable sources such as biomass, solar, wind and hydro into heat and power including their impact on the environment and climate change. He is also studying the combustion behaviour of different fossil fuels to get a better understanding of their environmental impacts. His expertises are in energy, energy optimisation, wastewater treatment, hydrogen production, fluidised bed combustion (FBC), life cycle assessment (LCA), oxy-fuel combustion, carbon capture and storage (CCS) and environmental management.
Dr Farooq Sher has published more than 200 research papers, several conference papers, book chapters and editorials. Apart from this, he is the editor of more than 10 different multidisciplinary scientific journals. He has reviewed more than 2000 journal papers for several journals.

Dr Nelson is a member of the Bioinformatics and Complex Systems research group and the Centre for Health, Ageing and Understanding Disease (CHAUD).
Current and previous areas of research in Mathematical Biology include:
Modelling the inflammatory response: Many medical conditions involve inflammation of the affected tissue, the resolution of which is key in determining the switch from chronic outcomes to the restoration of health. The inflammatory response involves complex interactions of various components of the immune system, with interactions between neutrophils and macrophages being particularly key. Previous and ongoing projects have taken either ODE, PDE or Cellular Automata approaches to modelling the inflammatory response and/or the cells that this response involves, to determine how various cellular mechanisms may be manipulated in the ongoing hunt for new treatments.
Morphogenesis and growth of soft tissues: Growing tissues are conveniently described using theories of nonlinear elasticity. Previous work has focused in particular upon growth-induced buckling in the developing human intestine, with links to tissue engineering and colorectal cancer.
Modelling of Tissue Engineering constructs: Recreating functional tissues in the laboratory requires the use of carefully-designed scaffolds. Previous work has deployed techniques of multiscale homogenization, together with fluid and solid mechanics, to describe flow in porous scaffolds, associated nutrient transport and tissue growth.
Problems in plant biology: Many of the above ideas transfer easily to problems in plant biology. Applications to date include the roles of dehydration in anther dehiscence - the process by which the anther opens in order to release pollen.
Multiscale models of sexually-transmitted infections: The replication cycles of many sexually-transmitted infections are complex, incorporating both subcellular processes and tissue-scale dynamics. Ongoing research is using a combination of PDE and cellular automata models to describe the spread of these infections within-host, and a recent project has developed associated software for STI simulation in silico.
Dynamics on networks: Many neurological conditions, in particular, are related to changes in the activity of various areas of the brain. By representing brain regions as nodes in a network, linked by either structural or functional connectivity information, we may examine how the activity of one brain region effects (or is affected by) the activity of others. Recent and ongoing projects in this area have specifically examined the impact of directed connections in cortical networks, and also delay-induced changes in network dynamics.

Amanda Coutts,amanda.coutts@ntu.ac.uk,School of Science & Technology,"Research areas
Tumour growth is achieved by overriding cell cycle control and bypassing cell death. Mechanisms influencing cell survival such as apoptosis and autophagy are key determinants of cell fate during stress. Moreover, during tumour progression the acquisition of metastatic potential is the most devastating event in human cancer with metastatic disease the cause of 90% of cancer deaths. Importantly, understanding how the cell integrates a variety of signals to affect a cellular outcome is clinically relevant and a poorly understood process.
Dr Coutt’s work involving the p53 co-factor JMY has uncovered novel links between cell motility and the DNA damage response as well as mechanisms involved in autophagy and cell survival. Her research seeks to explore how a transcription co-factor links the cytoskeleton with nuclear events during the stress response, how this impacts on p53 activity and cell survival, and the role of actin in these processes.

Dr Antonysunil’s research focus is Nutriepigenomics, the study of food nutrients and their effects on human health through epigenetic modifications. There is now considerable evidence that nutritional imbalance during pregnancy is linked to non-communicable diseases, such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension and cancer. If metabolic disturbances occur during critical time windows of development, the resulting epigenetic alterations can lead to permanent changes in tissue and organ structure or function and predispose individuals to metabolic disease.
Studies have shown that micronutrient vitamin B12 deficiency is associated with growth restriction in the foetus, increased risk of GDM in the mothers, and adiposity and insulin resistance in the children, neuro-development, sub-fertility and cancer. She has reported in clinical studies that maternal B12 deficiency was associated with higher cord blood lipid levels, with adverse maternal 1-C metabolites and B12 deficiency in T2D patients being associated with an adverse lipid profile in both Europeans and Indians. Her basic studies have shown for the first time in an in vitro model of adipocytes that low B12 was associated with hypomethylation of cholesterol transcription factor and with adipose derived circulating miRs targeting PPARγ and insulin resistance. These important findings raise key questions which encompasses her main research interests.
Main Research areas:
Tissue specific epigenetic changes in metabolic tissues such as adipose, liver and placenta
Role of miRs at early pregnancy and in cord blood
One-carbon metabolomics as early pregnancy biomarkers
Understanding the mechanisms of B12 and metformin
Role of B12 in bariatric surgery and prolonged use of acid-reflex medications

Nikolaos Kalfagiannis,nikolaos.kalfagiannis@ntu.ac.uk,School of Science & Technology,"Research areas
Dr Kalfagiannis research interests revolve around the design, modelling, characterisation and fabrication of photonic materials, processes and devices.
He is particularly focused on the light interactions with materials:
As a means of investigating the material’s optο-electronic properties and band structure, which in essence, are considered as non-destructive probe techniques;
Using high power lasers as a means to engineer, with precision, material’s optical, electrical and structural characteristics;
Exploit these tailored properties for various applications in electronics and photonics.
He is interested in:
Characterisation of the optical properties of solids via Spectroscopic Ellipsometry.
Finite-difference time-domain calculations.
Laser - matter interactions and metal nano-structuring.
Defect engineering via Laser Annealing in materials, such as transition metal nitrides, metal oxides, via laser annealing.
Alternative materials for plasmonics (such as transition metal nitrides, transparent conductive oxides) in collaboration with Prof. P. Patsalas (Aristotle University of Thessaloniki).
He is the contact Academic for an IR Variable Angle Spectroscopic Ellipsometer (IR-VASE). IR-VASE is the most accurate method for optically characterising thin films in the infrared. It provides accurate optical constants (n and k) from 1.7 to 40 microns (250 – 8000 cm-1) as well as film thickness, chemical information, semiconductor doping levels, and phonon absorption spectra. More information about the system can be found here: https://www.jawoollam.com/products/ir-vase-ellipsometer.
Dr Kalfagiannis is currently the Director of Studies of a PhD studentship in the area of “Defect Engineering of Transparent Conductive Oxides via laser processing for plasmonic applications”. He is also within the supervisory team of three additional PhD programmes (Photonic conversion of sol-gel organometallic precursors into inorganic thin films, Laser annealing of ZnO to produce an ultraviolet light-emitting diode, Laser engineered defect centres in nanomaterials for quantum technologies).

Alison Northrop,alison.northrop@ntu.ac.uk,School of Animal Rural & Environmental Sciences,"Research areas
Alison’s recent research has centred on the interaction between the horse and the surface it works on and the development of terminology to define the functional properties of synthetic sand-based surfaces used for racetracks and arenas. Alison co-led a two-year consultancy project to help develop the equestrian surfaces used for the London Olympic Games (2010-2012). The successful outcome of this project initiated the development of a consultancy group, Research and Consultancy in Equine Surfaces (RACES) that now consists of a collaboration between Nottingham Trent University and colleagues from The University of Central Lancashire and Myerscough College. Additionally Alison is interested in understanding more about the physiological demands of endurance riding and the effect that rider fitness has on the performance of the horse and has carried out work with the Endurance GB team and Plumpton College.
Current projects
Development of guidelines with which to assess equine surfaces for health and performance
Spatial and temporal variation in equine surfaces under various conditions
The influence that temperature has on both the physical and biomechanical properties of equestrian arenas and racetrack surfaces
The physiological demands of riding horses in endurance events

Research areas
Dr Mahmud’s research expertise and interest revolve around the following:
Advanced Machine Learning for Biological Data Analysis: Recent research in Deep and Reinforcement Learning, and their combination promise to revolutionize Artificial Intelligence. And, multimodal data from various application domains (e.g., Omics, Bioimaging, Medical Imaging, and [Brain/ Body]-Machine Interfaces) are piling up which requires novel data-intensive machine learning techniques. In this project, we have applied DL-based methods to analyse data from different biological sources.
Advanced Machine Learning for Crowd Analysis: This project aims to develop cutting-edge multisource crowd data analysis tools to develop a real-time automated transportation system for smart city applications.
Distributed Biosignal Analysis Framework: With the rapidly growing brain data, scientists require automated and intelligent tools to infer meaningful conclusions from them which, for a normal desktop PC, is becoming increasingly difficult. This project aims to harness the powers of distributed and cloud computing for the job.
Early Detection of Brain Network Dysfunction in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) & Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI): AD & MCI are characterized by altered brain network activity which is currently detected at a mature stage. In this project, we aim to characterize a stable biomarker detectable at the disease onset to facilitate their early diagnosis and treatment. Sophisticated frequency-based analyses, of in vivo LFP from genetically modified mouse models at different pathological stages, are applied to detect network dysfunctions.
High-Resolution Brain-Chip Interfacing: This project aims to develop high-resolution CMOS-based neuronal probes to acquire neuronal signals at (sub-)cellular resolution (7.5-100 microns) across different brain structures.
Neuroinformatics Tools for Extracellular Neural Signal Processing & Analysis: Automated analysis of multi-channel neural data has always been a huge challenge, especially when they are recorded in a low SNR setup. Under this umbrella project, we develop novel tools for the automated analysis of multi-channel brain signals.
Neuroprosthetics & Rehabilitation Engineering: This project aims to reduce rehabilitation costs and to provide independent mobility to the severely disabled through automatic and smart assistive devices controllable with bio-signals (e.g., EEG and EMG). These signals are mainly triggered by imagination, physical activities, and even just by looking at the way to follow. Also, fuzzy-based controllers are optimized to operate with minimal numbers of channels.
Secure Cyber-Physical Systems and Internet of Things: Rapid popularity of the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing permits neuroscientists to collect multilevel and multichannel healthcare data to better assess health conditions, diagnose diseases, and devise treatments. This project aims to ensure secure and reliable data communication between end-to-end devices supported by current IoT and cloud infrastructure through trust management as well as the development of novel secure IoHT frameworks.
Understanding Neural & Neuromuscular Behaviour through Modelling: To design appropriate therapy and realistic assistive devices for neurodegenerative disorders, we need to understand the neural transmission mechanisms in detail. In this project, we develop detailed models of neural networks suitable for electroceutical therapy and neuromuscular junction mimicking neurobiological phenomena.

John Wallis,john.wallis@ntu.ac.uk,Emeritus Professor of Organic Chemistry,"Research areas
The Wallis group has research activity in the areas of organic conductors and superconductors derived from organosulfur donors, the study of bond formation between functional groups by studies on molecules with partially formed bonds, and in aspects of heterocyclic chemistry. The group is also involved in medicinally related projects, in particular related to cancer. There are excellent facilities for synthetic chemistry and X-ray crystallography. He welcomes applications from potential PhD students. The most recent completed PhD theses are from students who came from Libya, Italy and UK.
Organic Conductors
A wide range of new substituted derivatives of the organosulfur donor BEDT-TTF have been prepared. Hydroxyl, amino and carboxyl derivatised materials provide both hydrogen bonding for organising the crystalline state, and also the potential for attachment of new molecular systems bringing new properties. Multi-substituted donors have been prepared, and a new strategy has been developed for providing such materials as one stereoisomer.
This has laid the foundation for a more crystal engineering approach to the design of conducting organic systems. The success in the synthesis has allowed the preparation of donors functionalised with metal binding groups which are being used for incorporation of magnetic metal ions to study the interplay of electrical and magnetic properties. The diastereoselective cycloaddition of a dithione to enantiopure alkenes has opened up access to enantiopure donors, so that the influence of chirality on electro-magnetic properties can now also be investigated. He collaborates extensively with colleague Dr Lee Martin.
The application of novel BEDT-TTF derivatives in molecular electronics, e.g. as components of transistors, is being explored.
Bond Formation Studies
The research group studies the formation of partial bonds between functional groups by measuring the X-ray structures of molecules in which those groups are forced close to one another, for example in peri-naphthalene systems. Accurate charge density measurements analysed by the “Atoms in Molecules” approach are used to study the stages of bond formation between the reacting groups, e.g. an amine and an electrophilic alkene, which are also complemented by solid state NMR measurements on the crystal studied. The interactions of oxyanions with electrophilic centres is a current area of study.
Intermolecular interactions have been modelled by the structures of 2,2’-disubstituted biphenyl systems, where the groups are free to move apart due to the free rotation about the central bond. This provides an alternative approach for those interactions which do not commonly occur in the Cambridge Structural Database.
Medicinal Chemistry
Collaboration with health scientists are directed at new anti-metastatic cancer agents and other therapies. The interdisciplinary approach combines computer aided design, synthesis of targets and biological testing.
Applications of reactive species such as cyclic sulfate esters and electron deficient alkynes to preparing heterocyclic compounds will be extended to the preparation of new libraries of compounds for biological testing.
Opportunities to carry out postgraduate research towards an MPhil/PhD exist in the areas of organic materials chemistry, organic chemistry and studies of molecular interactions and further information may be obtained from the NTU Graduate School.

Design of Novel Beta-blockers for the Retardation of Breast Cancer Metastasis.
Collaboration with Dr Amanda Miles, Dr Carl Nelson, Dr Chris Garner.
Epidemiological studies have shown a significant association between β-blocker usage and improved breast cancer patient outcome. These studies found that patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) benefitted the most from simultaneous intake of β-blockers. The rationale for using novel β2-selective β-blockers as a therapy for basal TNBC derives from their capacity to inhibit catecholamine-induced activation of G protein-coupled β2-adrenoceptors that drive cancer cell signalling pathways and cancer cell migration. Additional data obtained from pre-clinical and epidemiological studies has led to the hypothesis that β2-selective blockers are key mediators in preventing BC progression, rather than the β1-selective or β1/β2 non-selective counterparts. A panel of novel small molecules have recently been developed between Dr Amanda Miles (Jon van Geest Centre, NTU) and the synthetic chemistry laboratory of Prof John Wallis and Dr Chris Garner (Department of Chemistry and Forensics, NTU). Current work demonstrates that one of these novel compounds is able to significantly reduce the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro. We would now like to: (i) further investigate the novel compound’s biological effects and pharmacological profile (in collaboration with Dr Carl Nelson); (ii) investigate the metabolism and pharmacokinetic dynamics of the novel compound; before (iii) identifying its clinical utility in vivo. Furthermore, the synthetic chemistry component of the project is ongoing and concerns the preparation and purification of more of the most biologically active materials, as well as extending the family of drug candidates by making small molecular changes to the molecular structure of the lead. This interdisciplinary approach encompasses the range of skills needed in modern day drug development including computer aided drug design, chemical synthesis, receptor binding studies and subsequent biological testing of the compounds.
Mapping the process of bond formation by computation, synthesis and crystallography.
Dr Matt Addicoat, Prof. John Wallis.
When is a chemical bond actually formed? As two atoms approach each other, they reach a point where their electrons are shared between both atoms – a chemical bond. What we don’t know is where that point actually is, and what occurs either side of the “bond-forming transition state”. Understanding when and how two atoms share electrons to form a bond has important implications for the design of catalysts and the understanding of enzymes (Nature’s catalysts). In this project we will use computational crystal structure prediction to identify a series of molecules that have a range of constrained N---C separations. These molecules will then be synthesized and high-resolution X-ray crystallography will be used to determine the distribution of electrons in the N---C “bond” as it forms and ultimately show us the process of chemical bond formation.
Synthesis of 3,3’-Substituted Bipyridines with C-H Activation.
Dr Warren Cross and Prof. John Wallis
2,2’-Bipyridines used in extensively in coordination chemistry, and have applications in OLEDS, metal-organic frameworks and metal waste recovery.  However, there are no good routes to the 3,3’-disubstituted derivatives, but substituents in these positions have potential for installing small twists in the ligands and also offer least hindrance to systems with several bipyridines around a metal ion.  In this project we will develop a method for a catalytic C-H activation route to such materials, with the metal catalyst being coordinated at one pyridine ring and activating the 3-C-H on the other ring. Installation of two electrophilic groups into the bipyridine also offer substances for the study of N---electrophile interactions, and so this is a very interesting family of materials, which currently are not accessible.  The project will be supervised by Dr Warren Cross and Prof John Wallis
Organic Superconductors, Molecular Switches and Chiral Conductivity.
Dr Lee Martin, Prof John Wallis
This project concerns the application of BEDT-TTF derived organosulfur donors in the preparation of novel electroactive charge transfer salts, with applications in molecular electronics. This builds upon the recent achievement of a new superconductor and a new, near room temperature, electrical molecular switch from these materials. The project will involve organic synthesis of new donors including enantiopure ones, formation of charge transfer salts and characterisation of the structural and electrical properties of their salts, in some cases with novel complex magnetic anions.  The project will involve collaboration with Japanese research groups.",John Wallis,john.wallis@ntu.ac.uk,Emeritus Professor of Organic Chemistry,"Research areas
The Wallis group has research activity in the areas of organic conductors and superconductors derived from organosulfur donors, the study of bond formation between functional groups by studies on molecules with partially formed bonds, and in aspects of heterocyclic chemistry. The group is also involved in medicinally related projects, in particular related to cancer. There are excellent facilities for synthetic chemistry and X-ray crystallography. He welcomes applications from potential PhD students. The most recent completed PhD theses are from students who came from Libya, Italy and UK.
Organic Conductors
A wide range of new substituted derivatives of the organosulfur donor BEDT-TTF have been prepared. Hydroxyl, amino and carboxyl derivatised materials provide both hydrogen bonding for organising the crystalline state, and also the potential for attachment of new molecular systems bringing new properties. Multi-substituted donors have been prepared, and a new strategy has been developed for providing such materials as one stereoisomer.
This has laid the foundation for a more crystal engineering approach to the design of conducting organic systems. The success in the synthesis has allowed the preparation of donors functionalised with metal binding groups which are being used for incorporation of magnetic metal ions to study the interplay of electrical and magnetic properties. The diastereoselective cycloaddition of a dithione to enantiopure alkenes has opened up access to enantiopure donors, so that the influence of chirality on electro-magnetic properties can now also be investigated. He collaborates extensively with colleague Dr Lee Martin.
The application of novel BEDT-TTF derivatives in molecular electronics, e.g. as components of transistors, is being explored.
Bond Formation Studies
The research group studies the formation of partial bonds between functional groups by measuring the X-ray structures of molecules in which those groups are forced close to one another, for example in peri-naphthalene systems. Accurate charge density measurements analysed by the “Atoms in Molecules” approach are used to study the stages of bond formation between the reacting groups, e.g. an amine and an electrophilic alkene, which are also complemented by solid state NMR measurements on the crystal studied. The interactions of oxyanions with electrophilic centres is a current area of study.
Intermolecular interactions have been modelled by the structures of 2,2’-disubstituted biphenyl systems, where the groups are free to move apart due to the free rotation about the central bond. This provides an alternative approach for those interactions which do not commonly occur in the Cambridge Structural Database.
Medicinal Chemistry
Collaboration with health scientists are directed at new anti-metastatic cancer agents and other therapies. The interdisciplinary approach combines computer aided design, synthesis of targets and biological testing.
Applications of reactive species such as cyclic sulfate esters and electron deficient alkynes to preparing heterocyclic compounds will be extended to the preparation of new libraries of compounds for biological testing.
Opportunities to carry out postgraduate research towards an MPhil/PhD exist in the areas of organic materials chemistry, organic chemistry and studies of molecular interactions and further information may be obtained from the NTU Graduate School.

Design of Novel Beta-blockers for the Retardation of Breast Cancer Metastasis.
Collaboration with Dr Amanda Miles, Dr Carl Nelson, Dr Chris Garner.
Epidemiological studies have shown a significant association between β-blocker usage and improved breast cancer patient outcome. These studies found that patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) benefitted the most from simultaneous intake of β-blockers. The rationale for using novel β2-selective β-blockers as a therapy for basal TNBC derives from their capacity to inhibit catecholamine-induced activation of G protein-coupled β2-adrenoceptors that drive cancer cell signalling pathways and cancer cell migration. Additional data obtained from pre-clinical and epidemiological studies has led to the hypothesis that β2-selective blockers are key mediators in preventing BC progression, rather than the β1-selective or β1/β2 non-selective counterparts. A panel of novel small molecules have recently been developed between Dr Amanda Miles (Jon van Geest Centre, NTU) and the synthetic chemistry laboratory of Prof John Wallis and Dr Chris Garner (Department of Chemistry and Forensics, NTU). Current work demonstrates that one of these novel compounds is able to significantly reduce the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro. We would now like to: (i) further investigate the novel compound’s biological effects and pharmacological profile (in collaboration with Dr Carl Nelson); (ii) investigate the metabolism and pharmacokinetic dynamics of the novel compound; before (iii) identifying its clinical utility in vivo. Furthermore, the synthetic chemistry component of the project is ongoing and concerns the preparation and purification of more of the most biologically active materials, as well as extending the family of drug candidates by making small molecular changes to the molecular structure of the lead. This interdisciplinary approach encompasses the range of skills needed in modern day drug development including computer aided drug design, chemical synthesis, receptor binding studies and subsequent biological testing of the compounds.
Mapping the process of bond formation by computation, synthesis and crystallography.
Dr Matt Addicoat, Prof. John Wallis.
When is a chemical bond actually formed? As two atoms approach each other, they reach a point where their electrons are shared between both atoms – a chemical bond. What we don’t know is where that point actually is, and what occurs either side of the “bond-forming transition state”. Understanding when and how two atoms share electrons to form a bond has important implications for the design of catalysts and the understanding of enzymes (Nature’s catalysts). In this project we will use computational crystal structure prediction to identify a series of molecules that have a range of constrained N---C separations. These molecules will then be synthesized and high-resolution X-ray crystallography will be used to determine the distribution of electrons in the N---C “bond” as it forms and ultimately show us the process of chemical bond formation.

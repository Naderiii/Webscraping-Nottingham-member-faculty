Areas of clinical research interest for Professor Rutella’s team include:
Novel immunotherapy approaches for haematological malignancies.
Elements of this research work focus on the challenges encountered with the effective treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and combine systems biology approaches (targeted immune gene expression and miRNA profiling, spatially-resolved transcriptomic/proteomic profiling, spectral flow cytometry, computational immunology and bioinformatics expertise) to:
-Discover gene signatures that are reflective of general immune status and predictive of anti-cancer immune potential;
-Assess immune cell infiltration and the expression of immune checkpoint molecules;
-Identify ‘actionable’ targets/molecular pathways that can predict patient outcome and therefore assist the tailoring and improve the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions.
IFN-gamma-mediated tumour immune evasion and response to immunotherapy.
Pro-tumorigenic activities of IFN-gamma have recently emerged depending on the context, intensity and durability of IFN-gamma signalling. The research team is studying whether T-cell infiltration and IFN-gamma production in the AML bone marrow microenvironment correlate with patient response to immunotherapeutic agents, including bispecific antibodies and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. Cutting-edge technologies, such as GeoMx-DSP and single-cell RNA-sequencing, are being used to analyse the location, density and functional orientation of the different immune cell populations in primary tissue biopsies, i.e., the ‘immune contexture’ of the tumour microenvironment. We are also focusing on the role played by IFN-stimulated genes in mediating resistance of AML cells to chemotherapy agents.
Analysis of high-dimensional transcriptomic data from human tumours.
We have curated publicly available datasets for AML, melanoma, ovarian, prostate, lung and colorectal cancers. Each data set is currently being mined for multiple cancer-related features, including signatures of immune effector senescence. The group has expertise in the identification of molecular drivers of cancer phenotypes based on artificial neural network (ANN) analysis. We are also using immune deconvolution algorithms (CIBERSORT; PRECOG; EPIC; quanTIseq) to infer the frequency and quality of tumour-infiltrating immune cells from transcriptomic datasets and to identify immune determinants of patient response to therapy.
Pharmacological re-activation of mutant TP53 in acute myeloid leukaemia and its effect on the expression of inflammatory mediators.
TP53-mutated human malignancies, including AML, are characterised by chemotherapy resistance and have a poor clinical outcome. The great majority of TP53 mutations in AML are associated with loss-of-function (LOF) of the mutated protein. The team have generated data showing that TP53 mutations correlate with the expression of inflammatory molecules in the tumour microenvironment. This element of work aims to understand how the pharmacological re-activation of TP53 affects the expression of inflammatory genes in AML cells, with a focus on interferon-inducible molecules and on actionable  immune checkpoints. We use state-of-the-art gene expression profiling and proteomics platforms, as well as conventional cellular and molecular immunology techniques, to interrogate the immune transcriptome and proteome of AML cells harbouring common TP53 mutations, also dissecting the interplay between TP53 and STAT1, a key interferon-stimulated gene.

petros siegkas,petros.siegkas@ntu.ac.uk,School of Science & Technology,"Research areas
Dr Siegkas’ research within the field of solid mechanics includes developing and implementing experiment and modelling techniques related to material behavior and impact energy management in biomechanics and aerospace applications. Projects involved close collaboration with both industrial and academic partners of various fields. Current research interests include 3D printing, personalised protective equipment, and engineered meta-materials.
Porous-Cellular Materials
Dr Siegkas’ DPhil was focused on developing experiments and modeling techniques to characterise and model the static and dynamic performance of porous- cellular materials for use as biocompatible bone implants, and applications within the aerospace industry. Experiments involved mechanical testing at various strain rates and included the use of high speed photography, in-situ SEM, X-ray micro-tomography and image analysis.
A computational method was developed for virtually generating porous material prototypes and capturing their mechanical behavior at different scales thus providing a tool for virtual prototyping and characterisation, based on application requirements. The foam geometries were generated in Matlab using a method based on Voronoi polyhedrals, that could either mimic geometrical features (e.g. pore size distribution) obtained by X-ray tomography analysis or generate new prototype geometries. The geometries were then subjected to uniaxial and multiaxial mechanical loading at the mesoscale level from which the macroscale properties were obtained. The virtual specimens were simulated using finite element techniques (Abaqus) at different strain rates. The project was partially funded by Rolls Royce, EPSRC and in collaboration with the IMI Canada.
Metal Alloys-Ballistics-Aerospace Components
Dr Siegkas worked on the ballistic performance of granular materials (including Nickel at temperatures up to 800 degrees Celsius and Titanium alloys at room temperature) and jet engine components. The research was related to the aviation safety and impact energy management (i.e. jet engine fan blade off e.t.c.).
The projects were focused in designing experiments to generate data for material model calibration and validation or used for the development and optimisation of new materials. The aim was to capture the material mechanisms involved in managing energy dissipation and related to application requirements. The work was done in collaboration with industrial partners (Rolls Royce, TIMET) and has received a departmental award under the University of Oxford departmental recognition scheme. Results were subject to publishing restrictions.
Traumatic Brain Injury and Protective Equipment
During a PDRA position at Imperial College London, Dr Siegkas worked on projects related to understanding and preventing traumatic brain injury. The work involved implementing finite element models and extracting information as to regions of the brain that were mechanically affected by impact loading.
One of the projects was funded by the ‘’Welcome trust network of excellence’’ and was carried by a multidisciplinary team of experts from the fields of biology, neuroscience and solid mechanics. The second project was funded by the Welsh Government and was a collaboration between Imperial College and industrial partners (Dainese-AGV manufacturer of motorcycle helmets, Armougel manufacturer of liner add-on material). Dr Siegkas' role involved both experiments and computational modelling. Experiments included liner material characterisation (polymer), drop tower experiments on helmets (with and without added liner) and fitted on an instrumented head form. Modelling included using a head and brain model to extract information regarding potential injury and a full helmet-head form (Hybrid III) model of the drop tower tests aiming to extract information for further liner design and optimisation.",https://ntu.ac.uk/__search/s/redirect?collection=ntu~sp-global&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ntu.ac.uk%2Fstaff-profiles%2Fscience-technology%2Fpetros-siegkas&auth=G8iCCz11g%2Bg1WCclg%2FMvDA&profile=_default&rank=4&query=Faculty+member+of+biology+%7Ccategory%3A%22%24%2B%2B+Staff+%24%2B%2B%22

Stephanie McArdle,stephanie.mcardle@ntu.ac.uk,School of Science & Technology,"Research areas
Dr. McArdle is a Research Scientist in Tumour Immunology whose focus is on the development of T-cell vaccines against cancers. In particular, Dr. McArdle has identified a mutated Prostatic Acid Phosphatase, PAP, derived sequence, which, when injected with CAF09, a strong adjuvant (kind gift from Dr. Dennis Christensen, Serum Institute, Denmark), is capable of generating T-cells that produce high level of IFNg against vaccine-derived wild-type peptides using ex-vivo ELISPOT assay. This sequence has now been granted patent in Europe and in the US. Preclinical works are ongoing to gather the necessary data for a phase-0/I clinical trial for the treatment of hormone resistant prostate cancer. Dr. McArdle is also working on a HAGE- and mutated NY-ESO1-derived peptide sequences for the treatment of Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC). HAGE antigen has previously been shown to be a prognostic marker for breast cancer patients and a predictor of response to adjuvant chemotherapy (Abdel-Fatah, et al. 2014). In collaboration with Dr. Abdel-Fatah, HAGE was shown to be expressed in 47% of TNBC (Abdel-Fatah, et al. 2016). Dr. McArdle has recently set up a new collaboration with Dr. Sara Mangsbo at Upsala University (Sweden) where immune complexes will be used to deliver and stimulate strong immune responses against HAGE and NY-ESO1 sequences.
In addition, in collaboration with Scancell Ltd she is investigating the potential use of a combined TRP2 and WT1 vaccine for the treatment of Glioblastoma. Many of these antigens can also be used against other cancer, for example, HAGE and WT1 are also being investigated for the treatment of Leukaemia.
Dr. McArdle collaborates with many European laboratories which offers strong adjuvants such as CAF09 (Dr. Dennis Christensen, Serum Institute, Denmark), Immune-complexes (Dr. Sara Mangsbo (Upsala University, Sweden), L-Dopa, a precursor of melanin (Dr. Antoine Carpentier, Université Paris Descartes, Paris, France) as well as UK collaborator such as Prof. Lindy Durrant (Immunobody®, Nottingham University).
Dr. McArdle has also a particular interest in the effect of exercise, mental health and gut microbiota on the immune system of cancer patients and a study in ongoing in prostate cancer patients to assess the level of inflammation related molecules, the psychological status and the gut permeability of prostate benign vs cancer patients. She is keen to emphasise the importance of one’s life style on one’s health. She has previously organised two “Health and Well Being” day dedicated to promote self-help. The next “Health and Well-Being day” being scheduled for March 16th 2019.

Mark Turner,mark.turner@ntu.ac.uk,School of Science & Technology,"Research areas
Research in the Turner laboratory focuses upon elucidating molecular causes of disease and in identifying new treatment options. Specific areas of research are as follows:
Diet and Diabetes
Elevated circulating glucose and fatty acid concentrations are known to trigger and exacerbate type 2 diabetes. Dr Turner’s group is interested in identifying those genes whose expression becomes dysregulated during diabetes development, thereby leading to impaired function of key cells and tissues regulating glucose homeostasis. Recent research from the Turner group utilising both Affymetrix microarray and Illumina HiSeq next generation sequencing has enabled us to identify thousands of pancreatic genes whose expression level changes following exposure to high levels of glucose and/or fatty acids. Using a combination of different state-of-the-art non-biased bioinformatic algorithms we have now identified multiple pathways and individual targets that form the basis for current and upcoming outputs and investigations.
Protein Adduction, and Protective Action of Reactive Species Scavenging, in Metabolic Diseases
Proteomic data has recently been acquired from pancreatic beta-cells, skeletal muscle, and serum, detailing advanced glycation and lipidation endproduct modification of proteins exposed to metabolic stress. Crucially, the naturally occurring dipeptide, carnosine, can prevent / reverse many of these damaging modifications, indicating potential therapeutic action of this molecule. However, carnosine turns over quickly in the body, so we are currently screening and characterising a number of slowly-hydrolysable analogs (that act as either carnosinase inhibitors or carnosine mimetics) which could potentially be developed as more powerful treatments for metabolic diseases, including diabetes, obesity, and cancer.
Identification and Manipulation of Novel Targets to Enhance Insulin Secretion
Existing diabetes therapies tend to become less effective over time, meaning that there is an urgent and currently unmet clinical need to develop new therapeutic strategies to enhance insulin secretion. Dr Turner’s group has identified a number of intracellular signalling pathways linked to insulin secretion which become dysregulated by glucose and fatty acids. Translational molecular strategies are being pursued that can modify activity of these pathways, with the aim of developing new therapeutic treatments based on these strategies.
Current opportunities exist to carry out postgraduate research towards an MPhil / PhD in the areas identified above. Further information may be obtained on the NTU Research Degrees website:  https://www.ntu.ac.uk/research/research-degrees-at-ntu

Amanda Coutts,amanda.coutts@ntu.ac.uk,School of Science & Technology,"Research areas
Tumour growth is achieved by overriding cell cycle control and bypassing cell death. Mechanisms influencing cell survival such as apoptosis and autophagy are key determinants of cell fate during stress. Moreover, during tumour progression the acquisition of metastatic potential is the most devastating event in human cancer with metastatic disease the cause of 90% of cancer deaths. Importantly, understanding how the cell integrates a variety of signals to affect a cellular outcome is clinically relevant and a poorly understood process.
Dr Coutt’s work involving the p53 co-factor JMY has uncovered novel links between cell motility and the DNA damage response as well as mechanisms involved in autophagy and cell survival. Her research seeks to explore how a transcription co-factor links the cytoskeleton with nuclear events during the stress response, how this impacts on p53 activity and cell survival, and the role of actin in these processes.

Martin Nelson,martin.nelson@ntu.ac.uk,School of Science & Technology,"Research areas
Dr Nelson is a member of the Bioinformatics and Complex Systems research group and the Centre for Health, Ageing and Understanding Disease (CHAUD).
Current and previous areas of research in Mathematical Biology include:
Modelling the inflammatory response: Many medical conditions involve inflammation of the affected tissue, the resolution of which is key in determining the switch from chronic outcomes to the restoration of health. The inflammatory response involves complex interactions of various components of the immune system, with interactions between neutrophils and macrophages being particularly key. Previous and ongoing projects have taken either ODE, PDE or Cellular Automata approaches to modelling the inflammatory response and/or the cells that this response involves, to determine how various cellular mechanisms may be manipulated in the ongoing hunt for new treatments.
Morphogenesis and growth of soft tissues: Growing tissues are conveniently described using theories of nonlinear elasticity. Previous work has focused in particular upon growth-induced buckling in the developing human intestine, with links to tissue engineering and colorectal cancer.
Modelling of Tissue Engineering constructs: Recreating functional tissues in the laboratory requires the use of carefully-designed scaffolds. Previous work has deployed techniques of multiscale homogenization, together with fluid and solid mechanics, to describe flow in porous scaffolds, associated nutrient transport and tissue growth.
Problems in plant biology: Many of the above ideas transfer easily to problems in plant biology. Applications to date include the roles of dehydration in anther dehiscence - the process by which the anther opens in order to release pollen.
Multiscale models of sexually-transmitted infections: The replication cycles of many sexually-transmitted infections are complex, incorporating both subcellular processes and tissue-scale dynamics. Ongoing research is using a combination of PDE and cellular automata models to describe the spread of these infections within-host, and a recent project has developed associated software for STI simulation in silico.
Dynamics on networks: Many neurological conditions, in particular, are related to changes in the activity of various areas of the brain. By representing brain regions as nodes in a network, linked by either structural or functional connectivity information, we may examine how the activity of one brain region effects (or is affected by) the activity of others. Recent and ongoing projects in this area have specifically examined the impact of directed connections in cortical networks, and also delay-induced changes in network dynamics.

Research areas
Dr Mahmud’s research expertise and interest revolve around the following:
Advanced Machine Learning for Biological Data Analysis: Recent research in Deep and Reinforcement Learning, and their combination promise to revolutionize Artificial Intelligence. And, multimodal data from various application domains (e.g., Omics, Bioimaging, Medical Imaging, and [Brain/ Body]-Machine Interfaces) are piling up which requires novel data-intensive machine learning techniques. In this project, we have applied DL-based methods to analyse data from different biological sources.
Advanced Machine Learning for Crowd Analysis: This project aims to develop cutting-edge multisource crowd data analysis tools to develop a real-time automated transportation system for smart city applications.
Distributed Biosignal Analysis Framework: With the rapidly growing brain data, scientists require automated and intelligent tools to infer meaningful conclusions from them which, for a normal desktop PC, is becoming increasingly difficult. This project aims to harness the powers of distributed and cloud computing for the job.
Early Detection of Brain Network Dysfunction in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) & Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI): AD & MCI are characterized by altered brain network activity which is currently detected at a mature stage. In this project, we aim to characterize a stable biomarker detectable at the disease onset to facilitate their early diagnosis and treatment. Sophisticated frequency-based analyses, of in vivo LFP from genetically modified mouse models at different pathological stages, are applied to detect network dysfunctions.
High-Resolution Brain-Chip Interfacing: This project aims to develop high-resolution CMOS-based neuronal probes to acquire neuronal signals at (sub-)cellular resolution (7.5-100 microns) across different brain structures.
Neuroinformatics Tools for Extracellular Neural Signal Processing & Analysis: Automated analysis of multi-channel neural data has always been a huge challenge, especially when they are recorded in a low SNR setup. Under this umbrella project, we develop novel tools for the automated analysis of multi-channel brain signals.
Neuroprosthetics & Rehabilitation Engineering: This project aims to reduce rehabilitation costs and to provide independent mobility to the severely disabled through automatic and smart assistive devices controllable with bio-signals (e.g., EEG and EMG). These signals are mainly triggered by imagination, physical activities, and even just by looking at the way to follow. Also, fuzzy-based controllers are optimized to operate with minimal numbers of channels.
Secure Cyber-Physical Systems and Internet of Things: Rapid popularity of the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing permits neuroscientists to collect multilevel and multichannel healthcare data to better assess health conditions, diagnose diseases, and devise treatments. This project aims to ensure secure and reliable data communication between end-to-end devices supported by current IoT and cloud infrastructure through trust management as well as the development of novel secure IoHT frameworks.
Understanding Neural & Neuromuscular Behaviour through Modelling: To design appropriate therapy and realistic assistive devices for neurodegenerative disorders, we need to understand the neural transmission mechanisms in detail. In this project, we develop detailed models of neural networks suitable for electroceutical therapy and neuromuscular junction mimicking neurobiological phenomena.
Wireless Sensor Network for Healthcare Application: With the rise of service automation, access to digitized data, and growing network speed, this project aims to apply wireless sensor networks to provide e-healthcare solutions.",https://ntu.ac.uk/__search/s/redirect?collection=ntu~sp-global&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ntu.ac.uk%2Fstaff-profiles%2Fscience-technology%2Fmufti-mahmud&auth=usSIcm8Hq3MB%2Fw5xim90SQ&profile=global-search&rank=22&query=Faculty+member+of+biology+%7Ccategory%3A%22%24%2B%2B+Staff+%24%2B%2B%22

John Wallis,john.wallis@ntu.ac.uk,Emeritus Professor of Organic Chemistry,"Research areas
The Wallis group has research activity in the areas of organic conductors and superconductors derived from organosulfur donors, the study of bond formation between functional groups by studies on molecules with partially formed bonds, and in aspects of heterocyclic chemistry. The group is also involved in medicinally related projects, in particular related to cancer. There are excellent facilities for synthetic chemistry and X-ray crystallography. He welcomes applications from potential PhD students. The most recent completed PhD theses are from students who came from Libya, Italy and UK.
Organic Conductors
A wide range of new substituted derivatives of the organosulfur donor BEDT-TTF have been prepared. Hydroxyl, amino and carboxyl derivatised materials provide both hydrogen bonding for organising the crystalline state, and also the potential for attachment of new molecular systems bringing new properties. Multi-substituted donors have been prepared, and a new strategy has been developed for providing such materials as one stereoisomer.
This has laid the foundation for a more crystal engineering approach to the design of conducting organic systems. The success in the synthesis has allowed the preparation of donors functionalised with metal binding groups which are being used for incorporation of magnetic metal ions to study the interplay of electrical and magnetic properties. The diastereoselective cycloaddition of a dithione to enantiopure alkenes has opened up access to enantiopure donors, so that the influence of chirality on electro-magnetic properties can now also be investigated. He collaborates extensively with colleague Dr Lee Martin.
The application of novel BEDT-TTF derivatives in molecular electronics, e.g. as components of transistors, is being explored.
Bond Formation Studies
The research group studies the formation of partial bonds between functional groups by measuring the X-ray structures of molecules in which those groups are forced close to one another, for example in peri-naphthalene systems. Accurate charge density measurements analysed by the “Atoms in Molecules” approach are used to study the stages of bond formation between the reacting groups, e.g. an amine and an electrophilic alkene, which are also complemented by solid state NMR measurements on the crystal studied. The interactions of oxyanions with electrophilic centres is a current area of study.
Intermolecular interactions have been modelled by the structures of 2,2’-disubstituted biphenyl systems, where the groups are free to move apart due to the free rotation about the central bond. This provides an alternative approach for those interactions which do not commonly occur in the Cambridge Structural Database.
Medicinal Chemistry
Collaboration with health scientists are directed at new anti-metastatic cancer agents and other therapies. The interdisciplinary approach combines computer aided design, synthesis of targets and biological testing.
Applications of reactive species such as cyclic sulfate esters and electron deficient alkynes to preparing heterocyclic compounds will be extended to the preparation of new libraries of compounds for biological testing.
Opportunities to carry out postgraduate research towards an MPhil/PhD exist in the areas of organic materials chemistry, organic chemistry and studies of molecular interactions and further information may be obtained from the NTU Graduate School.
PhD projects available:
Design of Novel Beta-blockers for the Retardation of Breast Cancer Metastasis.
Collaboration with Dr Amanda Miles, Dr Carl Nelson, Dr Chris Garner.
Epidemiological studies have shown a significant association between β-blocker usage and improved breast cancer patient outcome. These studies found that patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) benefitted the most from simultaneous intake of β-blockers. The rationale for using novel β2-selective β-blockers as a therapy for basal TNBC derives from their capacity to inhibit catecholamine-induced activation of G protein-coupled β2-adrenoceptors that drive cancer cell signalling pathways and cancer cell migration. Additional data obtained from pre-clinical and epidemiological studies has led to the hypothesis that β2-selective blockers are key mediators in preventing BC progression, rather than the β1-selective or β1/β2 non-selective counterparts. A panel of novel small molecules have recently been developed between Dr Amanda Miles (Jon van Geest Centre, NTU) and the synthetic chemistry laboratory of Prof John Wallis and Dr Chris Garner (Department of Chemistry and Forensics, NTU). Current work demonstrates that one of these novel compounds is able to significantly reduce the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro. We would now like to: (i) further investigate the novel compound’s biological effects and pharmacological profile (in collaboration with Dr Carl Nelson); (ii) investigate the metabolism and pharmacokinetic dynamics of the novel compound; before (iii) identifying its clinical utility in vivo. Furthermore, the synthetic chemistry component of the project is ongoing and concerns the preparation and purification of more of the most biologically active materials, as well as extending the family of drug candidates by making small molecular changes to the molecular structure of the lead. This interdisciplinary approach encompasses the range of skills needed in modern day drug development including computer aided drug design, chemical synthesis, receptor binding studies and subsequent biological testing of the compounds.
Mapping the process of bond formation by computation, synthesis and crystallography.
Dr Matt Addicoat, Prof. John Wallis.
When is a chemical bond actually formed? As two atoms approach each other, they reach a point where their electrons are shared between both atoms – a chemical bond. What we don’t know is where that point actually is, and what occurs either side of the “bond-forming transition state”. Understanding when and how two atoms share electrons to form a bond has important implications for the design of catalysts and the understanding of enzymes (Nature’s catalysts). In this project we will use computational crystal structure prediction to identify a series of molecules that have a range of constrained N---C separations. These molecules will then be synthesized and high-resolution X-ray crystallography will be used to determine the distribution of electrons in the N---C “bond” as it forms and ultimately show us the process of chemical bond formation.
Synthesis of 3,3’-Substituted Bipyridines with C-H Activation.
Dr Warren Cross and Prof. John Wallis
2,2’-Bipyridines used in extensively in coordination chemistry, and have applications in OLEDS, metal-organic frameworks and metal waste recovery.  However, there are no good routes to the 3,3’-disubstituted derivatives, but substituents in these positions have potential for installing small twists in the ligands and also offer least hindrance to systems with several bipyridines around a metal ion.  In this project we will develop a method for a catalytic C-H activation route to such materials, with the metal catalyst being coordinated at one pyridine ring and activating the 3-C-H on the other ring. Installation of two electrophilic groups into the bipyridine also offer substances for the study of N---electrophile interactions, and so this is a very interesting family of materials, which currently are not accessible.  The project will be supervised by Dr Warren Cross and Prof John Wallis
Organic Superconductors, Molecular Switches and Chiral Conductivity.
Dr Lee Martin, Prof John Wallis
This project concerns the application of BEDT-TTF derived organosulfur donors in the preparation of novel electroactive charge transfer salts, with applications in molecular electronics. This builds upon the recent achievement of a new superconductor and a new, near room temperature, electrical molecular switch from these materials. The project will involve organic synthesis of new donors including enantiopure ones, formation of charge transfer salts and characterisation of the structural and electrical properties of their salts, in some cases with novel complex magnetic anions.  The project will involve collaboration with Japanese research groups.",https://ntu.ac.uk/__search/s/redirect?collection=ntu~sp-global&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ntu.ac.uk%2Fstaff-profiles%2Fscience-technology%2Fjohn-d-wallis&auth=pXI%2Fl3zeMXeV5v3hmRMOcw&profile=global-search&rank=32&query=Faculty+member+of+biology+%7Ccategory%3A%22%24%2B%2B+Staff+%24%2B%2B%22

Adaikala Antonysunil,adaikala.antonysunil@ntu.ac.uk,School of Science & Technology,"Research areas
Dr Antonysunil’s research focus is Nutriepigenomics, the study of food nutrients and their effects on human health through epigenetic modifications. There is now considerable evidence that nutritional imbalance during pregnancy is linked to non-communicable diseases, such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension and cancer. If metabolic disturbances occur during critical time windows of development, the resulting epigenetic alterations can lead to permanent changes in tissue and organ structure or function and predispose individuals to metabolic disease.
Studies have shown that micronutrient vitamin B12 deficiency is associated with growth restriction in the foetus, increased risk of GDM in the mothers, and adiposity and insulin resistance in the children, neuro-development, sub-fertility and cancer. She has reported in clinical studies that maternal B12 deficiency was associated with higher cord blood lipid levels, with adverse maternal 1-C metabolites and B12 deficiency in T2D patients being associated with an adverse lipid profile in both Europeans and Indians. Her basic studies have shown for the first time in an in vitro model of adipocytes that low B12 was associated with hypomethylation of cholesterol transcription factor and with adipose derived circulating miRs targeting PPARγ and insulin resistance. These important findings raise key questions which encompasses her main research interests.
Main Research areas:
Tissue specific epigenetic changes in metabolic tissues such as adipose, liver and placenta
Role of miRs at early pregnancy and in cord blood
One-carbon metabolomics as early pregnancy biomarkers
Understanding the mechanisms of B12 and metformin
Role of B12 in bariatric surgery and prolonged use of acid-reflex medications

Ivan Campeotto,ivan.campeotto@ntu.ac.uk,School of Science & Technology,"Research areas
Research interests in Campeotto’s group focus on understanding the mechanisms of infection of two parasites: Plasmodium falciparum and Trypanosoma cruzi, which are respectively the causative agents of malaria and Chagas disease.
Malaria infects approximately half a billion people worldwide and kills around 1 million people every year, three quarters of which are children under the age of 5 (WHO, 2016). There is no licensed vaccine and drug resistance has already been reported against artemisinin, currently the only leading therapy for malaria. The malaria projects target cyclic nucleotide binding proteins, protein kinases and other effector proteins, that are crucial for the establishment of the parasite infection and for the transmission to the mosquito. These projects are in collaboration with parasitologist Professor Rita Tewari (University of Nottingham).
Trypanosoma cruzi is endemic in South America, where approximately 10 million people are infected, causing approximately 20,000 deaths every year (WHO, 2016). The current therapies for Chagas disease produce severe side effects and are not effective against the chronic stage of the parasitic infection. The Trypanosoma cruzi projects are in collaboration with parasitologist Dr Martin Edreira at the University of Buenos Aires (Argentina) and aim to characterise novel T. cruzi proteins, which have been recently shown to play a key role in parasite development from a non-infective to an infective form.
In particular, Campeotto’s group is interested in elucidating the molecular details of host-pathogen interactions and in the key mechanisms that are responsible for the establishment of the parasite infection and for the development inside the host. To achieve this, a combination of structural and biophysical approaches is used, which combined with functional and in vivo studies, provides the ideal starting point for structure-guided drug design and a better understanding of parasite biology.
More recently, Campeotto’s research focused on a repertoire computational methods, which allowed him to design and to determine the crystal structure of an engineered variant of the Plasmodium falciparum RH5 protein, which is the leading candidate for the development of a blood-stage malaria vaccine (Campeotto et al., 2017- patent PCT/GB2017/052608).
A similar approach will be applied for the design of immunogens from other human pathogens through collaborations with leading experts. In particular, immunogenic molecules have been designed and engineered to be used to produce broadly neutralising antibodies against T. cruzi and to develop a Chagas vaccine. This project is in collaboration with Prof. John Kelly (London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, UK), Prof. Mark Howarth (University of Oxford) and Prof. Lea Barfod (University of Copenhagen, Denmark).",https://ntu.ac.uk/__search/s/redirect?collection=ntu~sp-global&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ntu.ac.uk%2Fstaff-profiles%2Fscience-technology%2Fivan-campeotto&auth=%2BXC7D%2B9Z3vwJpGncX3PsZg&profile=global-search&rank=69&query=Faculty+member+of+biology+%7Ccategory%3A%22%24%2B%2B+Staff+%24%2B%2B%22

I study bacterial pathogenesis, focusing on autotransporters of Gram-negative bacteria. These proteins are self-contained secretion systems and surface molecules that mediate a number of virulence functions. The proteins are found widely in Gram-negative bacteria, and I have studied a variety of autotransporters from organisms such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Yersinia enterocolitica. My work characterises both the functions of autotransporters as well as their secretion mechanism. In addition, as surface-exposed molecules and virulence factors, autotransporters are potential vaccine and drug targets.

Mike's doctoral thesis for his clinical training used qualitative (IPA) research with people whose experiences were akin to ""psychosis"" and for whom spiritual or religious beliefs were of strong importance (see Marriott, 2007, and Marriott et al, 2019, in the publications link).
Previous research within his NHS role was focused around the appropriate use of routine outcome measurement in CAMHS, and he played a clinical consultation and facilitation role in a strand of the local Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRC) project evaluating measure use and trialling innovative practices in data collection. He has also published an evaluation of psychotherapies in the adult mental health context, with a particular focus on Cognitive Analytic Therapy.
Mike provided methodological supervision of qualitative research with parents of adolescents diagnosed with “Anorexia Nervosa” and with users of a paediatric liaison service. He has consistently applied research skills to evaluations of clinical work across services, supporting and encouraging other healthcare professionals to adopt evaluative attitudes to clinical work. He is or has been part of a number of supervisory teams for doctoral projects at NTU, exploring various facets of mental health or applied psychological practice (including social cognition and people diagnosed with “schizophrenia”, adolescent sexting, trauma amongst young offenders, body image, and peer-led recovery programmes in mental health).
Mike’s main research activity currently is exploring direct assessments of body image, and the potential use of 3D body-scanning as an intervention tool to support people to achieve and maintain a healthy weight, with potential applications in either obese or “eating disordered” clinical populations. Future research plans are broadly in the field of the experiences of “eating disorders”, but particularly around understanding outcomes for young people, the development of these difficulties in males, and cultural considerations in treatment and management. He oversees a program of applied clinical research in the context of the MSc Psychology in Clinical Practice, and is happy to consider collaboration in any work looking broadly at people who access mental health services, using qualitative or quantitative methodology as appropriate to the research question.",https://ntu.ac.uk/__search/s/redirect?collection=ntu~sp-global&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ntu.ac.uk%2Fstaff-profiles%2Fsocial-sciences%2Fmike-marriott&auth=HHI6uDM9JIxXFFdPGDstdw&profile=global-search&rank=80&query=Faculty+member+of+biology+%7Ccategory%3A%22%24%2B%2B+Staff+%24%2B%2B%22

Samantha McLean,samantha.mclean@ntu.ac.uk,Bioscience,"Research areas
Dr McLean is a member of the Antimicrobial Resistance, Omics & Microbiota research group, situated within the Centre for Health, Ageing and Understanding Disease (CHAUD). Her research interests include investigating the microbial colonisation of medical device materials and the efficacy of novel approaches to prevent colonisation. She also has a wider interest in the characterisation of novel antimicrobial compounds.
The McLean group is part of the School of Science and Technology, within our rapidly evolving Clifton Campus, a multi-award-winning site with state of the art bioscience research and teaching labs. Campus is also home to the Medical Technologies Innovation Facility, a research and development facility available to industry and academic institutions to support and accelerate the development of innovative medical technologies.
Research interests:
Overarching research theme
The overuse and misuse of antibiotics in health care, agriculture and industry is pushing us towards a post antibiotic era. The rate at which antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is rising is vastly greater than the development of new antibiotics. Resistant strains are increasingly seen within the community where previously they were restricted to the hospital setting. Alongside this, resistance to last line antibiotics such as colistin is now more frequently observed. With yearly death rates attributed to AMR predicated to reach 10 million by 2050 it is vital that novel antimicrobial options are explored. Our research is focussed, via several projects, upon better understanding the activity of antimicrobial compounds and surfaces, so that we may drive the development of new antimicrobial products that will reduce the incidence and severity of infection.
Metals as antimicrobials
Metal-based compounds, including silver, copper and ruthenium,  offer potential as a antimicrobials. Silver has demonstrated antimicrobial application in numerous research studies and has been used widely as an antimicrobial throughout history. Today, silver salts are used in materials from advanced wound dressings to lunch boxes. Ruthenium-containing compounds have been less well studied but offer significant potential as a novel antimicrobials.
Our research group explores the antimicrobial action of metal-containing compounds to understand the mechanisms of action. We utilise a variety of antimicrobial efficacy assays, ranging from simple testing methods for rapid screening to in-depth analysis of antimicrobial activity and toxicity of compounds to moth larvae and human cell lines. Alongside this, transcriptomic analysis is undertaken using cutting-edge RNASeq technologies that allows us to understand how bacteria sense and respond to the threat of these novel antimicrobials.
Microbial colonisation of medical device materials (biofilms)
Microbial contamination caused by biofilms is a major global challenge, costing $4tn per annum across all industries, exerting economic, social, and environmental impact. Global business spends considerable resources on microbial contamination prevention and eradication technologies. Bacteria colonise surfaces by aggregating to form biofilms, which makes them resistant to antimicrobials and extremely difficult to remove. Bacterial infections caused by colonisation of implanted medical devices act as a driver of serious infections and current strategies to control them are limited to debridement, device removal and aggressive antibiotic treatment. Therefore, it is critical that medical device materials be developed with antibiofilm properties to reduce the incidence and severity of infections.
Our research here investigates ways to prevent and/or manage biofilm colonisation of innate surfaces on medical devices. We are developing models of biofilm formation in a variety of clinically relevant conditions, including in CDC Bioreactors, Drip Flow Reactors and Modified Robbins Devices, to screen the efficacy of new antimicrobial medical device materials in a manner that has real-world relevance and supports product development. We also aim to drive antimicrobial medical device development with industry and multi-disciplinary academic partners to translate our research into real-world impact.
Biofilm standards
Commercialisation of new materials that prevent microbial contamination need to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. However, within the UK there is a lack of standards that can be used to support product claims – such as “prevents biofilm formation”. This means that tests that are used are often inadequate for real world scenarios and lead to high failure rates as well as lengthy and costly regulatory claim processes. Industry consultation consistently provides the same messages: that the lack of biofilm standards is holding back industry innovation and leads to a failure to address these major challenges. Indeed, the UK government recognise the importance of standards stating that standards, measurement, and accredited conformity assessment play a critical role in supporting innovation and will enable its swift and safe commercialisation.
Therefore, it is not enough to only develop new antimicrobial materials, we must also invest time into the development of standard methodologies if we are to move the industry forward and break down these barriers to innovation. Dr McLean is a member of the British Standards Institute CH/216/0-/03 panel on products and biofilms  that are investigating the development of new BSI biofilm standards.

The CIA is well equipped with state-of-the-art computational and electronics design and test equipment. Of note is a 500 core HPC cluster; and a range of high-specification robots, including an iCUB, Sawyer, and Robotniq. Robotics research is facilitated with a 75m2 robot arena with VICON tracking system.
His main research interests concern the broad scientific themes of Artificial Perception and Cognition.  Within these themes, the following topics receive his main focus: probabilistic modelling of perception, perception and sensing for AI and field robotics in precision forestry and agriculture, and bioinspired perception and cognition for social robotics, co-robotics and human-robot interaction. However, his research interests are not limited to these subjects: over the years, he has also produced contributions in medical image processing and 3D scanning.
He is the main author of the 2014 textbook “Probabilistic Approaches for Robotic Perception” (Springer STAR series). He is a member of the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society since 2012 (RAS – Executive Committee member of the Portuguese Chapter from 2014 to 2018), and a member of the IEEE RAS Technical Committee on Cognitive Robotics since 2015, and member of the Technical Committee on Agricultural Robotics, TC AgRA, since 2019. He is also a member of the British Computer Society since 2019. He has been involved in several FP6, FP7 and H2020 European projects developed in consortium over the past few years and principal investigator (PI) of several nationally-funded projects.
João Filipe Ferreira has been leader of several undergraduate and graduate modules (including a doctorate studies module), having lectured to and mentored over 2,000 undergraduate and 30 graduate students since his first lecture. Following an integrated approach to teaching and research, he has also supervised/co-supervised a total of 5 undergraduate students, 11 M.Sc. students, 5 Ph.D. students and a post-doctoral fellow, either as a dissertation advisor, as a temporary supervisor during a visiting spell, or as a principal investigator. He was also a member of over 20 M.Sc. and 2 Ph.D. examining committees.
Current topics of research interest include:
Robotics and AI for a Sustainable Environment (RAISE): Despite many advances in key areas, the development of fully autonomous robotic and IoT solutions for precision/smart farming and forestry is still in a very early stage. This stems from the huge challenges imposed by many factors, in particular perception. Artificial perception for robots operating in outdoor natural environments has been studied for several decades. Nevertheless, despite many years of research a substantial amount of problems have yet to be robustly solved. Perception in agricultural and forestry robotics faces many challenges imposed at sensor-level by environmental conditions (trees and relief, weather conditions, dust, smoke, etc.), the homogeneity of natural landscapes, the diversity of natural obstacles to be avoided, and the effect of vibrations or external forces such as wind, among other technical challenges. There are also many other challenges that go beyond sensing, including safe operation (for both the robot and other living beings), multi-scale sensing and perception that allows the robot to tackle broad-range tasks such as navigation but also localised precision tasks, and covering specialised, expert-informed tasks necessary to achieve the greatest level of autonomy and usefulness possible. Potential projects in this topic include deep learning solutions for IoT in agriculture and forestry, semantic segmentation of woodland and farm scenes, development of robust, reusable and flexible perceptual architectures, and cooperative perception solutions for swarm robotics in the field.
Artificial Attention for Human-Robot Interaction: Despite remarkable advances in recent years, cognitive robotics is still lacking an understanding of the essential skills needed for the implementation robots capable of long-lasting interaction with humans in real-world applications. One of the most fundamental skills known to underpin the human ability of engaging in long-term interaction with other agents is perceptual attention, which allows for conveying and inferring intention through redirection of the senses (instilling a sense of non-verbal interaction) and the building of an internal model of the interlocutor's attentional stance, respectively. Potential projects include robust gaze direction estimation, attentional modelling, shared attention modelling, attentional processes in memory management and object of interest estimation in interaction.
Attention and Active Perception Supporting Robot Imitation Learning from Multi-Modal Human Demonstrations: Imitation learning in robots is when a robot is presented with a demonstration of a skill that it should learn to perform on its own. One-shot and few-shot learning is the act of learning to generalise from one or a few number of training examples per class, respectively. Currently, one- and few-shot learning are very challenging problems -- a probable reason for this is that scene task-relevance dictated by both the robot's knowledge of the world and the demonstrator's attentional stance is not explicitly being taken into account in what is clearly a shared attention scenario. Potential projects in this topic involve fundamental research on this issue, namely on how attention can be used to improve the performance of deep learning-based algorithms for robot imitation learning.
Opportunities to carry out postgraduate research exist and further information may be obtained from the NTU Graduate School.

Tom Caygill,tom.caygill@ntu.ac.uk,School of Social Sciences,"Research areas
Tom's wider research interests lie in parliamentary scrutiny of the executive and the legislative process. He is particularly interested in the relationship between executives and legislatures and the innovative ways in which parliaments seek to boost their influence with the executive. His interest in this area of legislative studies stems from the way governments within Westminster-style democracies can dominate legislatures. He received a PhD in Political Science from Newcastle University in June 2019, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council. His thesis examined post-legislative scrutiny in the UK Parliament and was the first systematic study of this type of parliamentary scrutiny. The thesis explored where and how often post-legislative scrutiny had taken place, what the processes of scrutiny involved, the extent to which committee recommendations were being accepted and how both Houses of the UK Parliament differ in their undertaking of it.
He has presented this research at European Consortium for Political Research and Political Studies Association Annual Conferences and at an ECPR summer school. He has also presented research at more specialist events, including events with the Westminster Foundation for Democracy.
His commitment to engagement and impact has been demonstrated through having given oral and written evidence to the Scottish Parliament’s Public Audit and Post-legislative Scrutiny Committee, as well as giving written evidence to both the House of Commons and House of Lords Liaison Committees for their respective inquiries into their committee systems. His drive to disseminate my research to both academic and practitioner communities has assisted him in building both national and international research networks.
Tom also has a burgeoning interest in teaching and learning research having assisted with two research projects during his time at Newcastle University, one focusing on student attendance and engagement and the other on study skills.

Amanda Miles,Unknown,Unknown,"Research areas
Current Research Areas:
1. The design of novel beta blockers for the retardation of breast cancer metastasis: Epidemiological studies have shown a significant association between β-blocker usage and improved breast cancer patient outcome. These studies found that patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) benefited the most from simultaneous intake of β-blockers. The rationale for using novel β2-selective β-blockers as a therapy for basal TNBC derives from their capacity to inhibit catecholamine-induced activation of G protein-coupled β2-adrenoceptors that drive cancer cell signalling pathways and cancer cell migration. Additional data obtained from pre-clinical and epidemiological studies has led to the hypothesis that β2-selective blockers are key mediators in preventing BC progression, rather than the β1-selective or β1/β2 non-selective counterparts. A panel of novel small molecules have recently been developed between Dr Amanda Miles (Jon van Geest Centre, NTU) and the synthetic chemistry laboratory of Prof John Wallis and Dr Chris Garner (Department of Chemistry and Forensics, NTU). Current work demonstrates that one of these novel compounds is able to significantly reduce the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro. We would now like to: (i) further investigate the novel compound’s biological effects and pharmacological profile (in collaboration with Dr Carl Nelson); (ii) investigate the metabolism and pharmacokinetic dynamics of the novel compound; before (iii) identifying its clinical utility in vivo. Furthermore, the synthetic chemistry component of the project is ongoing and concerns the preparation and purification of more of the most biologically active materials, as well as extending the family of drug candidates by making small molecular changes to the molecular structure of the lead. This interdisciplinary approach encompasses the range of skills needed in modern day drug development including computer aided drug design, chemical synthesis, receptor binding studies and subsequent biological testing of the compounds.
2. Combined novel beta-blocker and chemotherapy as a targeted treatment for breast cancer: Studies performed in our laboratory have shown that the novel beta blocker does not inhibit cell proliferation at therapeutically relevant concentrations. Modern day chemotherapeutics work on rapidly dividing cells and recent studies have shown that beta blockers can enhance the anti-proliferative effects of certain chemotherapeutic agents. In addition, administering a beta blocker also reduces the cardiotoxic effects that the chemotherapies have on the heart. Current research in our lab involves investigating the concomitant administration of our novel beta blocker with a anti-proliferative chemotherapeutic to investigate its effects on cancer proliferation, angiogenesis and metastasis.
3. Biological mass spectrometry as a tool for biomarker discovery: Within the mass spectrometry group Dr Miles is developing in vitro methods to define the impact of drug treatment on cancer cells at both the proteomic and secretomic levels. This is primarily in breast and prostate cancer but this work has also been extended to include bacterial samples.

Dr Gutierrez is a member of the Biosciences Team. His research interests include:
Energetics of the interaction between protein and biological molecules such as inhibitors, ligands, substrates and partner proteins (isothermal titration calorimetry).
Relation between ligand binding energy and functional dynamics in multi-domain proteins (thermodynamic, kinetic and structural aspects)
Redox activation of cytotoxic anti-cancer prodrugs by human cytochrome P450 reductase.
His work has focused especially in the reductase partner, cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR). Lately, he has been investigating the redox activation of anti-cancer prodrugs by CPR in collaboration with Prof. Ian Stratford (Manchester).
His area of expertise is in-vitro protein biochemistry: protein purification techniques, enzyme kinetics (the study of protein-catalysed reactions and its mechanisms), protein interactions with other biological molecules using calorimetry (isothermal titration calorimetry, differential scanning calorimetry) and in-solution determination of protein structures.
Training in protein biochemistry includes as well standard DNA modification protocols, specifically site-directed mutagenesis. This technique allows introducing changes in the amino acid composition of a protein by means of modifying its gene. In this way the relation between structure and function in a protein can be studied.

Understanding and Discovery of predictive biomarkers in rheumatological disorders.
Dr El-Sherbiny interests are focused on the identification of molecules and gene signatures that reflect the innate and adaptive immune systems activation, which leads to the immunopathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, particularly the role of interferon-mediated conditions. Recently, Dr El-Sherbiny has identified a gene expression signature which predicts disease progression in rheumatological disorders. He also identified critical immune molecules as biomarkers to stratify patients who respond to therapies and predict disease relapse aiming towards developing precision medicine approaches for rheumatological disease management.
Keywords/subheadings: Biomarkers, patient stratification, Interferon pathway, innate immune response, pDCs pathology and therapeutics
Investigating interferon pathway regulation/dysregulation & implications on immune signalling 
Interferon (IFN) mediated diseases are known to be of high morbidity and mortality disorders. Interferon repression using conventional monoclonal antibodies towards IFN receptors has been trialled as a therapeutic strategy. Although these means lately failed to meet targets in large clinical trials. This is maybe due to the complex nature of immune signalling that contributes to disease pathogenesis. Therefore, unconventional tactics which offer a modification of signalling output from multiple receptors have endeavoured.  Dr El-Sherbiny, in his collaborations studying the immune signalling and interference of the IFN pathway in order to evolve targeted unconventional therapies more beneficial and specific for IFN mediated autoimmune diseases.
Investigating omics changes in COVID-19 
The COVID-19 pandemic is a global crisis creating severe disruptions across the economy and health system. Dr El-Sherbiny interests are focused on learning and understanding the genetic determinants of COVID-19 susceptibility, severity, and outcomes. understanding gene signatures that reflect the innate and adaptive immune systems and contribute to global knowledge of the biology of SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease. Dr El-Sherbiny is collaborating internationally with COVID-19 host genetics initiative as well as the consortium of EASI-Genomics to investigate the genetic determinants of the disease,  the transcriptomic alterations and proteomic signature associated/leading to asymptomatic infection or with variable disease severity and death in particular of patients in Africa e.g.Egypt.
Mesenchymal Stem cells immunomodulation vs regeneration, towards innovative immunotherapeutic tactics
This research work is focusing on the properties of the immunomodulation of mesenchymal stem cells in regeneration and inflammation context. Dr El-Sherbiny presented an innovative approach by introducing a novel tactic of immunomodulation with implantation of cellular allograft bone into a non-bony site (patent WO2017100339) & recently published (El-Sherbiny et al. 2018)
Currently, Dr El-Sherbiny is mainly interested in identifying molecules and biomarkers which discriminates immunomodulatory MSCs. this will allow the development of innovative stem cell approaches and could enable lab bench to industry knowledge transfer. This may include:
Genetically modified cells for innovative therapies
Immunomodulation applications of Stem cells

Sean Myatt,sean.myatt@ntu.ac.uk,Nottingham School of Art & Design,"Research areas
Sean was the principal-investigator on an AHRC Research Network project, ‘Foundations for Object Theatre’, which created network opportunities for debate about emerging understandings of ‘Object Theatre’ in order to initiate a research agenda to establish object theatre as a separate discipline. Its focus was to explore its interdisciplinary history, clarify its methodology, and identify fruitful research questions and teaching methods.
Sean freelances as a consultant in puppetry and object theatre for performance, and has presented papers at the Wellcome Trust and international puppet festivals. He curated object theatre workshops for the Prague Quadrennial 2011 and the World Stage Design, Cardiff, 2013. His practice-based research includes running workshops for postgraduate students at SDU Design, University of Southern Denmark; facilitating workshops for Meeting Ground to train healthcare assistants; and performing, consulting and directing on productions including Before the Dawn, 2014, Kate Bush/The KT Fellowship, London.
In his research, Sean found that teachers, students and practitioners are not always aware of or using the entire range of approaches and techniques, e.g. there can be too much emphasis on giving the object human characterisations, rather than working with the object's material attributes and meanings. His research aims to broaden current understandings of object theatre for teachers, students, and those without specialist knowledge, as well as for object theatre professionals who are interested in exploring and debating alternative approaches and techniques.

Biomedical science and Cancer Immunology/Immunotherapy
Cancer immunology / immunotherapy research is conducted in the John van Geest Cancer Research Centre at Nottingham Trent University. It focuses on the identification of new tumour associated proteins, pre-clinical and clinical studies on tumour vaccines and the identification of peptide epitopes associating with MHC class I and class II antigens. The team of 15 research staff collaborates with major European Research Institutes. They are engaged in research to develop and apply cancer vaccines. A number of MHC associated peptides of tumour antigens have been identified and in some instances this has resulted in clinical vaccine-based trials.
Research in cancer immunology is therefore focussed on developing vaccines to treat patients with cancer. For this research molecular (SEREX cloning) and protein (phenomic fingerprinting by MALDI mass spectrometry-based methodologies are used. In particular, the use of MALDI mass spectrometry analysis and computer based bioinformatics provides a powerful means of identifying protein biomarkers associating with disease stage and response to therapy. The research is multidisciplinary, involving cellular and serological assays to detect tumour immune responses, biochemistry, analytical mass spectrometry, molecular biology and the development and application of artificial neural networks to identify biomarkers.

Dr Ugun-Klusek’s research focuses on investigating the biochemical and molecular events that drive neurodegeneration and currently she is exploring the role of Monoamine oxidases (MAOs) in this process. MAOs are mitochondrial enzymes that play a key role in maintaining neurotransmitter levels in the brain but also important in redox homeostasis because they generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a catalytic by-product. ROS can chemically modify proteins and alter their biological functions. If not cleared, oxidatively damaged proteins may become cytotoxic. Neurons are particularly vulnerable to ROS and mitochondrial dysfunction due to their high energy demand. Dr Ugun-Klusek’s current research is focusing on investigating the effect of MAO-A generated ROS on mitochondrial health and protein degradation signalling in the context of neurodegeneration. The long-term aim is to identify molecular pathways that control mitochondrial function and neuronal health/survival.
Dr Ugun-Klusek also interested in investigating the role of MAO-A in other pathological conditions such as cancers and the application of proteomics techniques to study disease mechanisms.

Carl Nelson,carl.nelson@ntu.ac.uk,School of Science & Technology,"Research areas
Current research areas:
1. Toll-like receptors and intercellular microRNA signalling in asthma.
Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are transmembrane pattern recognition receptors that play a key role in the early detection of pathogens and activation of the innate immune response. TLR7 and TLR8 both respond to short sequences of single-stranded RNA and are predominantly expressed in monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells. Several studies have found a genetic association between asthma susceptibility and TLR7/8 and there is extensive evidence that TLR7/8 agonists might ameliorate experimental asthma.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, non-coding RNA sequences that are potent repressors of gene expression. They can also be actively exported from cells and taken up by neighbouring cells. Crucially, certain miRNAs are capable of activating TLR7/8. We have shown that a number of miRNAs known to be elevated in asthmatic individuals are capable of robustly activating human TLR8 (but not TLR7) in human THP-1 monocytes and THP-1-derived macrophages. We are currently investigating the functional implications of this novel intercellular signalling pathway, in particular for macrophage differentiation/polarisation and phagocytosis. In future, would like to establish how this might influence asthma susceptibility and disease progression, as factors such as macrophage polarisation are known to influence asthma outcomes.
2. β-blockers as novel asthma therapies.
Activation of β2-adrenoceptors (β2-ARs) in the airways has a profound bronchodilatory effect and agonists at these receptors form a mainstay in the management of asthma. However, in the long-term, stimulation of these receptors may exacerbate airway inflammation, by a currently poorly-described mechanism. In contrast, there is emerging evidence that chronic treatment with β2-AR antagonists (so-called ‘β-blockers’) can be beneficial in both mouse models of asthma and in small scale trials with asthmatic patients. However, little is currently understood about how these benefits occur. We are investigating the effects of long-term treatment with β-blockers on both the proteome (using high-resolution quantitative Mass Spec (SWATHTM-MS) analysis in collaboration with Dr David Boocock (John van Geest Centre, NTU)) and cell biology of human airway epithelial cells. The aim is to identify pathways associated with beneficial changes, allowing the development of drugs that target these beneficial pathways at the expense of others and facilitating the design of more effective asthma therapies.
3. The design of novel beta blockers for the retardation of breast cancer metastasis.
Epidemiological studies have shown a significant association between β-blocker usage and improved breast cancer patient outcome. These studies found that patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) benefitted the most from simultaneous intake of β-blockers. The rationale for using novel β2-selective β-blockers as a therapy for basal TNBC derives from their capacity to inhibit catecholamine-induced activation of G protein-coupled β2-adrenoceptors that drive cancer cell signalling pathways and cancer cell migration. Additional data obtained from pre-clinical and epidemiological studies has led to the hypothesis that β2-selective blockers are key mediators in preventing BC progression, rather than the β1-selective or β1/β2 non-selective counterparts. A panel of novel small molecules have recently been developed between Dr Amanda Miles (Jon van Geest Centre, NTU) and the synthetic chemistry laboratory of Prof John Wallis and Dr Chris Garner (Department of Chemistry and Forensics, NTU). Current work demonstrates that one of these novel compounds is able to significantly reduce the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro. We would now like to: (i) further investigate the novel compound’s biological effects and pharmacological profile (in collaboration with Dr Carl Nelson); (ii) investigate the metabolism and pharmacokinetic dynamics of the novel compound; before (iii) identifying its clinical utility in vivo. Furthermore, the synthetic chemistry component of the project is ongoing and concerns the preparation and purification of more of the most biologically active materials, as well as extending the family of drug candidates by making small molecular changes to the molecular structure of the lead. This interdisciplinary approach encompasses the range of skills needed in modern day drug development including computer aided drug design, chemical synthesis, receptor binding studies and subsequent biological testing of the compounds.
4. Novel Therapeutic Approaches for Stroke-Associated Infections
Stroke-associated infections (SAI) constitute a very common and serious complication affecting one third of stroke survivors and correlate with a poor outcome and increased mortality. There is now an increasing evidence that SAI have a strong correlation with stroke-induced impairment to the systemic immune response. Unfortunately, no effective treatment is currently available to mitigate this risk. Moreover, the results of two recent randomized phase III clinical trials using prophylactic antibiotics demonstrated no clear benefits. Therefore, we are interested to develop novel therapeutic approaches that can ameliorate the immune system dysfunction after stroke and thus could tackle SAI. This project is in collaboration with the University of Manchester and University of Edinburgh and will be co-supervised with Dr Zahraa Al-Alhmady (who will be the principal supervisor).

Lucas Goehring,lucas.goehring@ntu.ac.uk,Physics and Maths,"Research areas
Along with his research group, Lucas studies complex fluids and complex solids – materials that consist of more than one phase of matter, mixed together. This covers a diverse range of topics and questions, but is generally held together by a few simple themes:
connecting the microscopic structure of such materials to their macroscopic properties,
understanding mechanical instabilities (e.g. fractures, wrinkling), and
applying these results in a broad, interdisciplinary way (e.g. polymer films to reptile scales or fossil biofilms; mud cracks to Martian permafrost).
Basically, this research asks the question: Why is the universe not boring?  Or, why is there so much structure, order, and pattern to life and nature, rather than a flat featureless expanse?  In response, his work has focused on using the tools of solid mechanics, pattern formation, and the physics of complex systems, to form bridges between controlling what happens on one length scale, and creating a response on another scale (or interpreting how a response happened).   Some examples include:
wrinkling of curved sheets – how does geometry control shape?
porous media flows, studied with microfluidic techniques.
geophysical patterns, like salt polygons, patterned ground, or columnar joints.
Fracture patterns, such as desiccation, biogenic or hydraulic cracks.
Colloidal dispersions, for example the dynamics of drying paint.

Dr Whiteford's research interests focus on:
the impacts of environmental change on aquatic and terrestrial ecology, with a particular focus on whole organism biochemistry and physiology.
the mechanisms which enable lichen forming fungi to tolerate extreme, nutrient poor habitats, how they can be used as biological indicators and what role they play in shaping low resource ecosystem structure and function.
the effects of changes in the biogeochemical cycling of nutrients (carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus) on the structure and function of low-resource habitats, especially the Arctic.
taking palaeoecological and contemporary ecological approaches, undertaking limnological surveys, growth bioassays, nutrient analyses and using multiproxy palaeoecological techniques.
Erika's areas of expertise are:
in the analysis of lake sediments for fossil diatom assemblages and algal chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments to reconstruct environmental change impacts on lakes over time.
in the analysis of water, algal, plant and soil samples for chemical composition and extracellular enzyme activity associated with nutrient acquisition.  This combination of skills means she can apply knowledge from field observations, contemporary studies and experimental bioassays from both aquatic and terrestrial systems to help interpret environmental change from palaeoecological reconstructions in high latitude ecosystems.
investigating cross-system linkages and biogeochemical transfers between key ecosystems at the landscape scale.

Dawn Scott,dawn.scott@ntu.ac.uk,School of Animal Rural & Environmental Sciences,"Research areas
Dawn's principal areas of research are focused on the interactions between humans and wildlife, such as, the consequences of anthropogenic change of the environment on mammalian communities, genetics, biodiversity and their ecology. This information is then integrated into developments of conservation biology theory and practice. She is also passionate about science communication and citizen science based research approaches.
There are four main themes she is currently working on in conservation biology. These fundamentally address some of the long term consequences of our current approaches to conservation.
Species responses to anthropogenic landscape change and management: Investigating the ecological response of species and biodiversity to habitat change and human activity, for example, urbanisation, wetland habitats, anthropogenic activities and management.
Human-wildlife coexistence: Investigating the ecological and socio-economic issues surrounding human-wildlife interactions in South Africa and in the UK.
‌Landscape conservation genetics: The genetic consequences of landscape structure and permeability on wildlife population genetics, using jackal and brown hyena populations in South Africa, and, hazel dormice and water voles in the UK as models to investigate this.
Behavioural responses to management to inform conservation practice: As part of an interdisciplinary team, she is investigating the impact of landscape and animal management on animal behaviour focusing on species of conservation concern including the white rhino in South Africa and urban mammals in the UK.",https://ntu.ac.uk/__search/s/redirect?collection=ntu~sp-global&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ntu.ac.uk%2Fstaff-profiles%2Fscience-technology%2Fkarin-garrie&auth=pPNrBu%2FW5JmFVIQ0%2FHVROg&profile=global-search&rank=146&query=Faculty+member+of+biology+%7Ccategory%3A%22%24%2B%2B+Staff+%24%2B%2B%22

Silvia Ottaviani,silvia.ottaviani@ntu.ac.uk,School of Science and Technology,"Research areas
Dr Silvia Ottaviani's research is focused on investigating the role of non-coding RNAs, specifically microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs, in pancreatic cancer. In particular, Dr Ottaviani is interested in understanding how non-coding RNAs regulate the metastatic process, a multi-step process that involves the interplay between tumour cells and the microenvironment resulting in the spread of the cancer from the primary site. Pancreatic cancer is a deadly disease with high metastatic potential and most patients are often diagnosed with metastatic disease. Dr Ottaviani aims to identify novel targets for therapy for this stage of the disease. She is also interested in identifying circulating microRNAs in plasma or serum of cancer patients to discover novel biomarkers that can be easily translated to the clinic.
Current projects:
MicroRNAs as biomarkers for COVID-19 disease
Investigating tumour heterogeneity using single-cell RNA sequencing
Use of nanoparticles for delivery of anti-miRNAs in pancreatic cancer
The role of microRNAs in the tumour microenvironment
The role of long non-coding RNAs in pancreatic cancer progression
